// Hidden Treasure
// Given a 2D array representing a map of the ocean floor that includes a hidden treasure, and an array with the coordinates ([row, column]) for the next dive of your treasure search, return "Empty", "Found", or "Recovered" using the following rules:

// The given 2D array will contain exactly one unrecovered treasure, which will occupy multiple cells.
// Each cell in the 2D array will contain one of the following values:

// "-": No treasure.
// "O": A part of the treasure that has not been found.
// "X": A part of the treasure that has already been found.
// If the dive location has no treasure, return "Empty".
// If the dive location finds treasure, but at least one other part of the treasure remains unfound, return "Found".
// If the dive location finds the last unfound part of the treasure, return "Recovered".
// For example, given:

// [
//   [ "-", "X"],
//   [ "-", "X"],
//   [ "-", "O"]
// ]
// And [2, 1] for the coordinates of the dive location, return "Recovered" because the dive found the last unfound part of the treasure.

function dive(map, coordinates) {
  console.log(map, coordinates);
  // find the character in matrix
  // loop over map
  for (row = 0; row <= map.length; row++) {
    for (col = 0; col <= map[i].length; col++) {
      if (map[row] === coordinates[0] && map[row][col] === coordinates[1]) {
        console.log('Hello');
      }
    }
  }
  return map;
